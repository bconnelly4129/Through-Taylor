				<p>Taylor Allison Swift is a 32-year-old American singer and songwriter. Her music is inspired by her personal life and the things she has gone through. She has a total of 206 songs between her singles and her albums. Starting off with her very first album named Taylor Swift which was released on October 24, 2006, with 11 songs included. My personal favorite from this album is “Picture To Burn”. It is my favorite because it has an amazing beat and is very relating when thinking about aggravation and breakups. This album is classified as the country era of Taylor because at this time she was a country singer/songwriter. At the time this album was released I was only one so I obviously did not hear her songs written when they came out. I heard this album for the first time when I was around 9 years old. As the older I got the more and more I grew to relate to her songs from this album and appreciate them more.

			<p>The second album that Taylor Swift released is called Fearless; the release date for this album was November 11, 2008. This album was still classified as country but her songs started to add a bit of pop into the songs to be classified as country-pop. My favorite song from the original Fearless album is “The Way I Loved You”. Jump into the present time Taylor swift re-recorded this album in order to gain ownership over it and get her songs back and unattached from her previous record label. The re-recorded album was released on April 9, 2021. The re-recorded album had some unreleased songs from before changing my new favorite Fearless song to “Mr. Perfectly Fine”. The re-recorded fearless album is now called Fearless( Taylor’s Version). This is to show her new ownership over the songs. Being able to re-experience listening to the songs again for the first time was one of the best feelings. Especially since the re-releasing of this album was during covid and quarantine I had a lot of time to listen to and enjoy this album.

		<p>The third album that Taylor swift released is called Speak Now; the release date of this album was October 25, 2010. This album is classified as country-pop because some of her songs still were country while others were more pop. The majority of the songs on this album are about her heartbreaks as she is transitioning into adulthood because she is now no longer a teenager. My favorite song on this album is “Better than Revenge”. This is because this song is all about revenge and when you are mad at someone it is a great song to jam to on full speaker. With a close second “Enchanted” and “The Story of Us” are also two of my favorite songs because they kinda track the process of a relationship about how you feel or how in Love you are with someone and then how you feel after the relationship is over. Currently, this album has not been re-recorded but I definitely think it will in the next year or so and I am so excited to hear the progression of these songs.

		<p>The fourth album that Taylor Swift released is called Red; The release date of this album was October 22, 2012.  This album was a transition album for Taylor because this is when her music started to go more on the pop side. Picking a favorite song on this album is almost impossible because I love them all. My top songs on this album would be “Stay Stay Stay” and “All too Well”. Even though these two songs mean the exact opposite from each other I relate to them both on different levels. “Stay Stay Stay”  is about wanting someone to stay with you even when you are mad a them which I relate to because I struggle to let go of people. I also relate to “All too Well” because it is the realization when you are in a bad place with someone and you reminisce the times you had together but that the relationship is no longer in a good place. This album is Taylor Swift’s most recent re-recorded album with it being released on November 12, 2021. Since I was at a young age when I first heard all these songs I did not relate to or understand them I just liked the sound of them. So being able to re-hear them at an age when I understand them and relate more is a great experience. From the re-recorded album I still love “Stay Stay Stay”  and “All too Well” but with All too well she released a never heard 10-minute version that is absolutely amazing. There were also a couple more unreleased songs that were released in the re-recording; there were two of them that I fell in love with. They are  “Message in a Bottle” and “The Very First Night”. These songs have such an upbeat tone and they are great songs to blast on the radio in any mood.

		<p>The firth album that Taylor Swift released is called 1989; the release date of this album was October 27, 2014.  This is my personal favorite of all of her albums. The reason behind this is because this is the very first album I ever heard of Taylor Swift. When this album was released I was 9 years old so it was not like I was going through a tragic heartbreak at the time. I just liked the sounds of the songs so I would pay them over and over and then I was introduced to her previously made albums. That was the point that I fell in love with her music. My two favorite songs on this album are “How to Get the Girl” and “Wonderland”. Even though this full album has not to been re-recorded a song from it was. The cool thing about this is the very first song I ever heard of Taylor Swift was “Wildest Dreams” and now it is currently the only re-recorded song on this album. The re-recorded of “Wildest Dreams” was released on September 17, 2021. Being able to re-hear the very first song I ever heard from Taylor swift over again for the first time in a new light is amazing. This album was named after the year she was born 1989 and the point behind this album was to define herself and her music. She was creating music genuine to herself and that is why it is named after the year she was born because that expresses her.

		<p>The sixth album Taylor Swift released is called Reputation; the release date of this album was November 10, 2017. In the period of time between 1989 and reputation, Taylor was receiving large amounts of hate for her music and her life in general and it was broadcasted all over media platforms. This album was different from other albums because the songs were much more vengeful as she was done caring about what others thought about her and how the media was portraying her so she did what she does best and wrote songs about how she felt. My favorite songs from this album are "This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things", "Don't Blame Me" and "Call It What You Want". I enjoy these songs because when I am mad at someone they are great songs to jam to and they validate my feelings of anger. When this album was released I was around 12 years old so by then I had experienced multiple friends' losses that made me resentful and relate to some of the songs.

			<p>The seventh album Taylor Swift released was called Lover; the release date for this album was August 23, 2019. This album is different from all the other ones she has made because she has broken out from her original producers. For all of her other albums, she was under Big Machine Records and they would not allow her to be the owner of her own music. With the release of lover, her label is now Republic Records. This album is all about equality and feminism. I have a lot of favorite songs on this album. Some of them are "I Forgot That You Existed", "Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince", "Death by a Thousand Cuts" and "Cruel Summer". All of these songs radiate happiness with the beta because they are all very upbeat. There is not a single song on this album that I dislike.

			<p>The eighth album Taylor Swift released was called Folklore; the release date for this album was July 24, 2020. The release of this album was during the first few months of covid and Taylor wrote all of these songs during covid. They definitely had a different style from all her past albums. The genre of music of Folklore was more indie-folk and alternative rock. The songs were definitely sadder but they went along with the current time. This is because we were all stuck at home so it was nothing to be jumping with joy about. It was very poetic and relaxed. My favorite songs from this album are "The 1", "The Last Great American Dynasty", and "Exile". I was able to have the songs on repeat because it was literally the only thing I had to do and look forward to. This album was not the typical type of music I listen to but because Taylor Swift made it, it was amazing!

		</div>	<p>The ninth album Taylor swift released is called Evermore; The release date for this album was December 11, 2020. This was the sister album to Folklore because it was similar to Folklore. This album was a little more upbeat than Folklore classifying it with a genre of folk-pop. Evermore is her most recent release of a new album. After the release of Evermore, there was the re-recording of Fearless and Red but Evermore is the most recent one she wrote. My favorite songs on this album are "Champagne Problems", "No Body, No Crime" and "Tis the Damn Season". </p>
